Setup analysis shows you how each of your trading strategies is performing — ranked by the metrics that matter. It answers the question every trader should be asking: "Which of my setups actually make money?"

## How to access it

Go to **Analysis → Setups** in the sidebar. You'll see a breakdown of every setup you've assigned to trades, with performance metrics for each one.

## What you'll see

For each setup, TurtleMetrics calculates:

| Metric | What it tells you |
|---|---|
| **Win Rate** | Percentage of trades using this setup that were profitable |
| **Total P&L** | How much money this setup has made or lost overall |
| **Profit Factor** | Gross profit ÷ gross loss for trades using this setup. Above 1.0 is profitable, above 2.0 is strong |
| **Trade Count** | How many trades you've tagged with this setup |
| **Average P&L** | Mean profit or loss per trade — helps compare setups with different trade counts |

## Reading the data

The most important thing is to look at setups with enough trades to be meaningful. A setup with 3 trades and a 100% win rate doesn't tell you much. A setup with 50 trades and a 65% win rate tells you a lot.

<Warning>
  Don't draw conclusions from small samples. Wait until a setup has at least 20–30 trades before making decisions based on its performance data.
</Warning>

### What to look for

- **High win rate + high profit factor** — This is a setup you should keep trading. Your edge is real.
- **Low win rate + low profit factor** — Consider whether this setup belongs in your playbook. The data says it's costing you money.
- **High win rate + low profit factor** — You're winning often but your losers are bigger than your winners. Look at how you're managing risk on these trades.
- **Low win rate + high profit factor** — You lose often but your winners are much larger. This can be a valid strategy, but make sure you're comfortable with the losing streaks.

## Filtering

You can filter setup analysis by date range and account, just like the dashboard. This is useful for seeing how your setups perform in different market conditions or comparing performance across sim vs. live accounts.

## Actionable next steps

The whole point of setup analysis is to make better trading decisions:

1. **Double down** on setups with proven profitability
2. **Investigate** setups with borderline numbers — maybe they work in specific conditions
3. **Cut** setups that consistently lose money — your data is telling you something
