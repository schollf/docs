Risk/reward ratio (R:R) tells you how much you risked compared to how much you made on a trade. A trade where you risked 10 ticks to make 30 ticks has a 3:1 R:R — you made 3x what you put at risk. Tracking R:R across all your trades reveals whether you're being adequately compensated for the risk you take.

## Why risk/reward matters

Win rate alone doesn't tell you if you're trading well. A trader with a 60% win rate who risks 20 ticks to make 5 ticks is losing money. A trader with a 40% win rate who risks 5 ticks to make 20 ticks is making money. R:R is the missing piece that connects your win rate to actual profitability.

When you track R:R alongside your other metrics, you can answer questions like:

- Am I consistently cutting winners short and letting losers run?
- Do certain setups produce better R:R than others?
- Is my average R:R improving over time?

## How TurtleMetrics calculates R:R

To calculate R:R, TurtleMetrics needs to know your **stop loss** for each trade. Your risk is the distance between your entry price and your stop loss. Your reward is the distance between your entry and your actual exit.

**R:R = Reward ÷ Risk**

For example, if you go long ES at 5000 with a stop loss at 4995 (5 points of risk) and exit at 5015 (15 points of reward), your R:R is 15 ÷ 5 = **3.0**.

There are two ways to get stop loss data into TurtleMetrics:

## Option 1: Risk Tool indicator (recommended)

The **TurtleMetrics Risk Tool** is a free NinjaTrader indicator that captures your stop loss directly from the chart while you're trading. It's the fastest, most accurate way to track R:R because it happens in real-time as part of your normal workflow.

### How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter a position">
    When you open a trade in NinjaTrader, the Risk Tool automatically detects your new position and draws a horizontal **stop loss line** on the chart. If you're using an ATM strategy, the line snaps to your ATM stop price automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust the line if needed">
    The stop loss line is draggable. If you're not using an ATM, drag it to where your actual stop loss is. The indicator displays the distance from entry in both points and ticks as you move it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Confirm SL">
    Once the line is in the right place, click the **Confirm SL** button on the chart. The stop loss price is locked in and sent to TurtleMetrics when the trade closes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

That's it — three steps, a few seconds of effort per trade, and TurtleMetrics has the data it needs to calculate your R:R.

### Installing the Risk Tool

The Risk Tool is installed separately from the main TurtleMetrics Sync AddOn:

1. Download the Risk Tool indicator from your TurtleMetrics account
2. In NinjaTrader, go to **Tools → Import → NinjaScript Add-On** and select the downloaded file
3. Add the indicator to your chart: right-click the chart → **Indicators** → find **TurtleMetrics - Risk Tool** → click **Add** → **OK**

<Info>
  The Risk Tool requires the TurtleMetrics Sync AddOn to be installed. It communicates the confirmed stop loss to the AddOn, which then sends it along with your trade data to TurtleMetrics.

### Customization options

The Risk Tool is fully customizable from NinjaTrader's indicator settings:

| Setting | What it controls | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Line Color** | Color of the stop loss line | Orange-red |
| **Line Style** | Solid, dashed, or dotted | Dashed |
| **Line Width** | Thickness of the line (1–5) | 2 |
| **Text Side** | Which side of the chart shows the SL distance label | Left |
| **Line After Confirm** | What happens to the line after you confirm: Remove, Dim, or Keep Visible | Remove |
| **Button Position** | Corner of the chart for the Confirm SL button | Top Right |
| **Horizontal/Vertical Offset** | Fine-tune the button position in pixels | 80 / 50 |

### ATM strategy integration

If you trade with NinjaTrader ATM strategies, the Risk Tool automatically detects your ATM stop loss order and places the SL line at that price. If your ATM stop moves (trailing stop, for example), the line updates in real-time until you confirm. This means you often just need to verify the line is correct and click Confirm — no dragging needed.

## Option 2: Manual stop loss entry

If you don't want to use the indicator, you can enter stop losses manually after the fact:

1. Open any trade in TurtleMetrics (from the [Calendar](/features/calendar) day view)
2. Click **Edit Trade Details**
3. Enter your stop loss price in the **Stop Loss** field
4. Save

TurtleMetrics calculates the R:R from the stop loss you entered, your entry price, and your actual exit price.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When to use manual entry">
    Manual entry works well if you're reviewing historical trades that were taken before you installed the Risk Tool, or if you occasionally forget to confirm the SL during a trade. It's also useful for traders who want to enter their *planned* stop loss rather than the one that was active on the chart.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When to use the indicator">
    The indicator is better for ongoing, day-to-day tracking. It's faster (a few seconds per trade vs. editing after the fact), less likely to be forgotten, and captures your actual stop loss at the time of the trade rather than what you remember later.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Reading your R:R data

Once you have stop losses on your trades, R:R appears alongside your other trade details. Over time, you'll be able to see:

- **Average R:R** — Are you generally being compensated well for your risk?
- **R:R by setup** — Which strategies produce the best risk-adjusted returns?
- **R:R distribution** — Are you cutting winners (low R:R) or letting them run?

<Warning>
  R:R is only meaningful on trades that have a stop loss entered. Trades without a stop loss won't have R:R calculated. The more consistently you track your stops, the more complete your risk data becomes.
</Warning>
