The dashboard is the first thing you see when you open TurtleMetrics. It gives you an at-a-glance view of how your trading is going — the key numbers that matter, without digging into individual trades.

## What's on the dashboard

The dashboard shows your performance across a selected time period (defaulting to the last 30 days). You can adjust the date range to look at any window you want.

### Key metrics

| Metric | What it tells you |
|---|---|
| **Total P&L** | Your gross profit or loss over the selected period, with a trend line showing how it's moved over time |
| **Average Trades Per Day** | How actively you're trading — useful for spotting overtrading patterns |
| **Profit Factor** | Gross profit divided by gross loss. Above 1.0 means you're making more than you're losing. Above 2.0 is strong |
| **Consistency Score** | How stable your win rate is over time — high consistency means your edge is reliable, not just a lucky streak |

### Recent trades

Below the metrics, you'll see a table of your most recent closed trades showing the date and time, symbol, side (long or short), and assigned setup. Winning trades are highlighted in green, losing trades in red — giving you an instant visual read on your recent performance.

## Filtering your view

You can filter the dashboard by:

- **Date range** — look at today, this week, this month, or any custom period
- **Account** — if you're tracking multiple NinjaTrader accounts, filter to see one at a time

This makes it easy to compare performance across different accounts or time periods without the data getting mixed together.

## How to use the dashboard

The dashboard is designed for quick check-ins, not deep analysis. Open it after your trading session to see how the day went, or at the start of the week to review your recent trend. For deeper dives into what's working and what isn't, head to the analysis tools:
