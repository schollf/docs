Tags are one of the most powerful tools in TurtleMetrics. Instead of writing free-text notes about your trades (which are impossible to analyze at scale), you assign structured tags that turn your observations into measurable data.

## Why tags instead of notes?

Most trading journals let you write notes like "took profits too early" or "chased the entry." The problem? You can't run analytics on free text. After 500 trades, you have no way to know how often you took profits early or how much it actually cost you.

With tags, "took profits early" becomes a data point you can filter, sort, and measure. TurtleMetrics can tell you exactly how many times you tagged a trade this way, what your win rate was on those trades, and how much P&L you left on the table.

## How tags work

A tag is a short label you assign to a trade. You can assign multiple tags to a single trade.

Tags are organized into **categories** — groups that help you structure your tagging system. For example:

| Category | Example Tags |
|---|---|
| Execution Quality | Perfect entry, Chased entry, Late entry, Early exit, Held to target |
| Market Conditions | Trending, Choppy, Low volume, News event |
| Emotional State | Confident, Revenge trade, FOMO, Patient |
| Mistakes | Moved stop, Oversized, No setup, Broke rules |

## Creating categories and tags

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Management → Tags">
    Open the Tags & Categories page from the sidebar navigation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a category first">
    Click **Create Category**, give it a name (e.g., "Execution Quality"), and pick a color. Categories are visual groupings that keep your tag list organized.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add tags to the category">
    Click **Create Tag**, enter a label (e.g., "Chased entry"), and select the category it belongs to.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You can create as many categories and tags as you need. Start with a small set (10–15 tags) and expand as you identify more patterns in your trading.

## Assigning tags to trades

You assign tags to trades from the **Calendar Day** view:

1. Navigate to the calendar and select a trading day
2. Click on a trade to view its details
3. Click the tag assignment area and select the relevant tags
4. Tags are saved immediately

The goal is to tag trades during your daily review — right after the trading session while everything is still fresh. It takes a few seconds per trade and builds a dataset that becomes incredibly valuable over time.

## Analyzing tag performance

Once you've tagged enough trades, head to **Analysis → Tags** to see the impact:

- **Win rate by tag** — Which behaviors correlate with winning trades?
- **P&L by tag** — How much does each pattern actually cost or earn you?
- **Profit factor by tag** — Are certain behaviors consistently profitable or consistently expensive?
- **Trade count** — How frequently does each pattern occur?

This is where the real insights live. You might discover that "chased entry" trades have a 25% win rate while "patient entry" trades sit at 65%. That's not a feeling — it's data you can act on.

## Tips for effective tagging

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start small">
    Don't create 50 tags on day one. Start with 2–3 categories and 10–15 tags total. You can always add more as you discover what matters.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tag consistently">
    The value comes from consistent application over time. A tag used on 5 trades isn't statistically meaningful. After 30+ trades with a given tag, the patterns start to emerge.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Be specific">
    "Bad trade" doesn't help you improve. "Entered without confirmation" tells you exactly what to fix.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Include positive tags too">
    Don't only tag mistakes. Tags like "perfect execution" or "held to target" help you identify what you're doing right so you can do more of it.
