A setup is a label for the trading strategy or pattern you used on a trade. By assigning a setup to every trade, you build a performance record for each strategy — letting you see exactly which ones make money and which ones don't.

## Why use setups?

Most traders have a handful of strategies they trade regularly — breakouts, pullbacks, failed breaks, opening range plays, etc. But without tracking which setup each trade used, you're guessing at which strategies actually work for you.

Setups turn that guessing into data. After a few weeks of consistent tagging, you can open [Setup Analysis](/features/setup-analysis) and see the win rate, P&L, and profit factor for every strategy you trade.

## Creating setups

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Management → Setups">
    Open the Setups page from the sidebar navigation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new setup">
    Click **Create Setup** and give it a name that matches how you think about your strategies. Keep names short and descriptive.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repeat for each strategy">
    Add all the setups you regularly trade. You can always add more later as you identify new patterns.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example setups

The right setups depend entirely on how you trade. Here are some examples to get you started:

| Setup Name | Description |
|---|---|
| Failed Break | Price breaks a level then reverses back through it |
| Pullback to EMA | Trend continuation after a pullback to a moving average |
| Opening Range Breakout | Breakout above or below the first 15/30-minute range |
| Support/Resistance | Trade off a key price level |
| Gap Fill | Fade a gap back toward the previous close |
| Trend Continuation | Entry in the direction of the dominant trend |

<Info>
  Start with 3–5 setups that cover your main strategies. You can always add more as your trading evolves. Too many setups from the start makes tagging feel like a chore.

## Assigning setups to trades

You assign setups from the [Calendar Day](/features/calendar) view:

1. Navigate to a trading day and click on a trade
2. Select the setup from the dropdown
3. The setup is saved immediately

Each trade gets **one setup** — the primary strategy or pattern you used for that entry. This keeps the data clean and makes setup-level analytics meaningful.

## Setups vs. tags

Setups and [tags](/features/tags-and-categories) serve different purposes:

| | Setups | Tags |
|---|---|---|
| **Per trade** | One setup | Multiple tags |
| **Purpose** | What strategy you used | Observations about execution, conditions, behavior |
| **Example** | "Pullback to EMA" | "Perfect entry," "Trending market," "Held to target" |
| **Answers** | "Which strategies make me money?" | "Which behaviors help or hurt my trading?" |

Use both together for the fullest picture — setups tell you *what* you traded, tags tell you *how* you traded it.
