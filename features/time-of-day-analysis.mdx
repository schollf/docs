Time-of-day analysis breaks down your trading performance by the hour, showing you exactly when you trade well and when you don't. It's one of the simplest ways to improve your results — stop trading during your worst hours.

## How to access it

Go to **Analysis → Time of Day** in the sidebar. You'll see a breakdown of your performance across each hour of the trading day.

## What you'll see

TurtleMetrics shows your metrics grouped by hour, including:

| Metric | What it tells you |
|---|---|
| **P&L by hour** | How much you've made or lost during each hour of the day |
| **Win rate by hour** | Your win percentage for trades taken during each hour |
| **Profit factor by hour** | Whether each hour is net profitable or net costly |
| **Trade count by hour** | How many trades you take during each hour — useful for spotting overtrading patterns |

The data is displayed as a heatmap-style visualization so you can quickly spot your best and worst hours at a glance — green for profitable periods, red for losing ones.

## Common patterns traders discover

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Strong open, weak afternoon">
    Many traders find they perform best in the first 90 minutes of the session and steadily decline after that. If your data shows this, consider calling it a day after the morning session.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Lunchtime losses">
    The midday hours (roughly 11:30 AM–1:30 PM ET) are notorious for choppy, low-volume price action. Lots of traders lose money during lunch without realizing it until they see the data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Overtrading in the afternoon">
    High trade count + low win rate in the afternoon often signals overtrading — taking low-quality setups to "make back" morning losses. The time-of-day view makes this pattern impossible to ignore.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How to use this data

The most powerful takeaway from time-of-day analysis is knowing when to *stop* trading. If your data consistently shows that you lose money between 2–4 PM, the simplest improvement you can make is to shut off your platform at 2 PM.

You can also use it to:

- **Optimize your schedule** — Focus your energy on your most profitable hours
- **Set trading rules** — "No new trades after 11:30 AM" backed by actual data
- **Compare across conditions** — Filter by date range to see if your timing patterns change with market conditions

## Filtering

Like all analysis views, you can filter by date range and account. This lets you compare your timing patterns across different periods or between sim and live accounts.

<Info>
  Time-of-day patterns can shift as you improve. Check back periodically to see if the hours you used to struggle with have improved — or if new problem areas have emerged.
