TurtleMetrics tracks several key metrics across your dashboard and analysis views. Here's what each one means, how it's calculated, and what to look for.

## Win Rate

**What it is:** The percentage of your trades that were profitable.

**Formula:** (Winning trades ÷ Total trades) × 100

**What to look for:** Win rate alone doesn't tell the whole story. A 40% win rate can be extremely profitable if your winners are much larger than your losers. A 70% win rate can lose money if your losses are outsized. Always look at win rate together with profit factor.

## Profit Factor

**What it is:** The ratio of your gross profits to your gross losses.

**Formula:** Total gross profit ÷ Total gross loss

**What to look for:**

| Profit Factor | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| Below 1.0 | You're losing money overall |
| 1.0–1.5 | Marginally profitable — small edge |
| 1.5–2.0 | Solid profitability |
| Above 2.0 | Strong edge |
| Above 3.0 | Excellent — but verify with enough sample size |

Profit factor is one of the most useful single metrics because it captures both win rate and win/loss size in one number.

## Consistency Score

**What it is:** A measure of how stable your win rate is over time.

**Why it matters:** A trader with a 55% win rate that's consistently 55% every week is in a very different position than one whose win rate swings between 20% and 90%. The consistency score helps you understand how reliable your edge is — whether your results are steady or highly variable.

## Average P&L Per Trade

**What it is:** Your total P&L divided by the number of trades.

**Why it matters:** This tells you the expected value of each trade you take. If your average P&L per trade is positive, you have a positive expectancy — over many trades, you should make money. If it's negative, you're losing money on average with each trade you take.

## Largest Win / Largest Loss

**What they are:** The single biggest winning trade and single biggest losing trade in the selected period.

**Why they matter:** These help you check if your P&L is being driven by a few outlier trades or by consistent performance. If your total P&L is positive but one massive winner accounts for most of it, your edge might not be as reliable as the headline number suggests.

## Trade Count

**What it is:** The total number of trades in the selected period, using [flat-to-flat counting](/troubleshooting/trade-count-differences).

**Why it matters:** More trades means more data and more reliable metrics. It's also useful for monitoring overtrading — if your trade count is climbing but your win rate and P&L aren't keeping up, you may be forcing trades.

## How metrics work across filters

All metrics in TurtleMetrics recalculate dynamically when you apply filters. Change the date range, switch accounts, or look at a specific setup or tag — the numbers update to reflect exactly the slice of data you're looking at.

This means you can ask questions like "What's my win rate on Monday mornings?" or "What's my profit factor on pullback setups in live accounts?" and get precise answers.
