TurtleMetrics automatically syncs every trade you take in NinjaTrader — no manual entry, no CSV exports, no copy-pasting. Once set up, your trades appear in your journal within seconds of closing a position.

## What you'll need

- A TurtleMetrics account ([sign up free](https://app.turtlemetrics.com/register) — 14-day trial, no credit card)
- NinjaTrader 8 installed on Windows
- An active NinjaTrader connection (sim or live)

## Setup steps

The whole process takes about 3–5 minutes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the NinjaTrader AddOn">
    Download and import the free TurtleMetrics Sync AddOn into NinjaTrader.
    [→ Installation guide](/getting-started/install-addon)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate your API token">
    Create a secure API token in your TurtleMetrics account to authenticate the connection.
    [→ API token guide](/getting-started/api-token)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your trading accounts">
    Select which NinjaTrader accounts you want to monitor (up to 10).
    [→ Account setup guide](/getting-started/connect-accounts)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import historical trades (optional)">
    Pull in all your past NinjaTrader trades with one click.
    [→ Historical import guide](/getting-started/import-historical-trades)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start trading">
    That's it. Every trade you close in NinjaTrader now automatically appears in TurtleMetrics.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once your first trade syncs, the onboarding screen disappears and you'll see your full trading dashboard.
