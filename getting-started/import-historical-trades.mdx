You don't have to start from scratch. TurtleMetrics can import all your historical trades from NinjaTrader so you have analytics on your past performance from day one.

## How to import

<Steps>
  <Step title="Make sure the AddOn is connected">
    Open the TurtleMetrics Sync window in NinjaTrader and verify it shows "Connected" status with a valid API token and at least one monitored account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Sync Everything">
    In the TurtleMetrics Sync window, click the **Sync Everything** button. This tells the AddOn to scan your entire NinjaTrader trade database and send all historical executions to TurtleMetrics.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for the sync to complete">
    The import runs in the background. Depending on how many trades you have, it may take a few moments. You can check progress in NinjaTrader's Output window (**New → Output**).
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once complete, all your past trades appear in the TurtleMetrics calendar and are included in your analytics.

## What gets imported

The import pulls all closed trades from your monitored accounts that exist in NinjaTrader's database. This includes all execution data needed to calculate P&L, trade duration, and contract details.

<Info>
  NinjaTrader only stores trade data that's in its local database. If you've previously cleared or reset your NinjaTrader database, trades from before the reset won't be available for import.
</Info>

## Duplicate prevention

TurtleMetrics automatically prevents duplicate imports. If you click **Sync Everything** multiple times or if some trades were already synced in real-time, the system skips trades that are already in your account. There's no harm in running it again.

## After importing

Once your historical trades are in, you can immediately:

- Browse past trading days in the [Calendar](/features/calendar)
- See aggregate performance on the [Dashboard](/features/dashboard)
- Start [tagging trades](/features/tags-and-categories) to build your analytics dataset
- Assign [setups](/features/setups) to categorize your strategies

<Info>
  Historical trades won't have tags or setups assigned yet. Consider reviewing your recent trading days and tagging them — even retroactive tagging builds valuable data for your analytics.
