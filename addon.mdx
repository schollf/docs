The TurtleMetrics Sync AddOn runs inside NinjaTrader and automatically sends your trade data to TurtleMetrics whenever you close a position. It's free and takes about 2 minutes to install.

## Prerequisites

- NinjaTrader 8 installed on Windows
- A TurtleMetrics account ([sign up free](https://app.turtlemetrics.com/register))

## Download the AddOn

## Installation steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open NinjaTrader">
    Make sure NinjaTrader 8 is running.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import the AddOn">
    Go to **Tools → Import → NinjaScript Add-On...** in the NinjaTrader menu bar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the ZIP file">
    Navigate to your Downloads folder and select the `TurtleMetricsSync.zip` file you just downloaded. You do not need to unzip it first.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart NinjaTrader">
    Close and reopen NinjaTrader to complete the installation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the installation">
    After restarting, go to **New → TurtleMetrics Sync** in the menu. If you see this option, the AddOn is installed correctly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next step

Now you need to generate an API token to connect the AddOn to your TurtleMetrics account.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I don't see 'TurtleMetrics Sync' in the New menu">
    Make sure you fully restarted NinjaTrader after importing the AddOn. If it still doesn't appear, try importing the ZIP file again — NinjaTrader sometimes silently fails if it was busy during the first import.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="NinjaTrader shows an import error">
    Ensure you're using NinjaTrader 8 (not NinjaTrader 7). The AddOn is not compatible with older versions. Also verify that the ZIP file downloaded completely and wasn't corrupted.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use TurtleMetrics on a Mac?">
    TurtleMetrics itself is a web app that works on any device with a browser. However, the NinjaTrader AddOn requires Windows since NinjaTrader 8 only runs on Windows. If you run NinjaTrader through a Windows VM or VPS, you can install the AddOn there.
