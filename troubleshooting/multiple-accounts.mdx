TurtleMetrics supports up to 10 monitored accounts per user. Each account's data is completely isolated — separate P&L, separate analytics, separate everything. This makes it straightforward to track multiple trading accounts without data getting mixed together.

## Setting up multiple accounts

Adding accounts is done in the NinjaTrader AddOn:

1. Open the TurtleMetrics Sync window (**New → TurtleMetrics Sync**)
2. Check each account you want to monitor from the available list
3. Click **Save Settings**

All selected accounts begin syncing immediately. For a detailed walkthrough, see the [Connect Trading Accounts](/getting-started/connect-accounts) guide.

## How account isolation works

Every metric in TurtleMetrics is calculated per account. When you switch between accounts in the app, you're looking at completely independent data sets:

- **Dashboard** — shows P&L, win rate, profit factor for the selected account only
- **Calendar** — shows trades from the selected account only
- **Analysis** — all setup, tag, and time-of-day metrics are scoped to the selected account

This means your sim account performance never inflates your live account numbers, and your prop firm evaluation results stay separate from your personal account.

## Common multi-account setups

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sim + Live">
    Track both your sim and live accounts to compare performance. This is especially useful when transitioning from sim to live — you can see if your edge holds up with real money on the line.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Personal + Prop Firm">
    Keep your personal trading account separate from prop firm evaluation accounts. Each has different rules and constraints, so isolated analytics give you a clearer picture of each one.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Strategy-specific accounts">
    Some traders use different accounts for different strategies. By monitoring each one separately, you get clean performance data per strategy without any cross-contamination.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Copy-trading across accounts">
    If you execute the same trades across multiple accounts (copy-trading), each account tracks independently. You'll see the same trades in each account's calendar with P&L adjusted for that account's contract size and commission setup.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Account changes and broker reassignments

If your broker assigns you a new account number (common with prop firm evaluations or account migrations):

1. The old account and its data remain in TurtleMetrics
2. Add the new account number in the NinjaTrader AddOn
3. New trades will sync under the new account

The old account's history isn't lost — it just becomes a separate, complete record of that account's trading.

## The 10-account limit

TurtleMetrics monitors up to 10 NinjaTrader accounts. This is a deliberate design choice that covers the vast majority of trading setups. If you're hitting this limit and need more, email [support@turtlemetrics.com](mailto:support@turtlemetrics.com) and we'll work something out.
