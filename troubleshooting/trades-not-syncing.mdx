If your trades aren't appearing in TurtleMetrics after closing positions in NinjaTrader, work through these checks in order. Most issues are resolved in the first two steps.

## 1. Wait a few seconds

NinjaTrader doesn't write trade data to its database instantly. There's typically a **5+ second delay** after you close a position before the data is available for the AddOn to sync. If you just closed a trade, give it 10–15 seconds before checking TurtleMetrics.

## 2. Check that the AddOn is running

The TurtleMetrics Sync AddOn needs to be actively running in NinjaTrader:

1. In NinjaTrader, look for the TurtleMetrics Sync window. If you don't see it, open it via **New → TurtleMetrics Sync**
2. Check that the AddOn shows a "Connected" status
3. Verify your API token is entered and saved

<Warning>
  The AddOn window can be minimized or hidden behind other NinjaTrader windows. Make sure it's actually open, not just installed.
</Warning>

## 3. Verify your API token

An invalid or expired API token will silently prevent syncing:

1. In TurtleMetrics, go to **Management → API**
2. Check that you have an active token
3. Copy the token and paste it into the NinjaTrader AddOn's API Key field
4. Click **Save Settings** in the AddOn

If you previously revoked and regenerated your token, the AddOn still has the old one. You need to update it manually.

## 4. Check the monitored accounts

The AddOn only syncs trades from accounts you've explicitly selected:

1. Open the TurtleMetrics Sync window in NinjaTrader
2. Check the **Monitored Accounts** list
3. Make sure the account you're trading on is included
4. If it's not listed, select it from the available accounts and add it

This is a common issue when switching between sim and live accounts, or when your broker assigns a new account number.

## 5. Check NinjaTrader's output window

NinjaTrader's Output window often contains useful error messages:

1. Go to **New → Output** in NinjaTrader
2. Look for any lines mentioning "TurtleMetrics"
3. Common messages include authentication errors, connection timeouts, or API issues

<Info>
  If you contact support, please include a screenshot of any TurtleMetrics-related messages from the Output window. This dramatically speeds up troubleshooting.

## 6. Try a manual sync

If live syncing isn't working but you need your trades:

1. Open the TurtleMetrics Sync window
2. Click **Sync Everything**
3. This triggers a full re-sync of all trades from your monitored accounts

This can also help after a NinjaTrader database reset or if trades were taken while the AddOn wasn't running.

## 7. Check your internet connection

The AddOn sends trade data to TurtleMetrics over HTTPS. If your firewall or network blocks outbound connections, syncing will fail silently. Ensure NinjaTrader can reach `app.turtlemetrics.com`.
